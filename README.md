# Internship--Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Car-features-and-msrp-dataset.
In this project, i have performed Exploratory data analysis on how the different features of a car and its price are related. The data comes from the Kaggle dataset "Car Features and MSRP". It describes almost 12,000 car models, sold in the USA between 1990 and 2017, with the market price (new or used) and some features.
